There were two requirements for this lab: 
1.To create a mySort() function to sort an array of integers. 
	This was completed with no errors by using an insertion sort algorithm. 
2. To modify the sortMain.c to be able to detect command line arguments, and if found to use those arguments instead of the ones originaly given. 
	This was completed with no errors as well by using an if else statment. 


The completion of this lab was delayed due to not having setup a 2 factor authentication in class. I explicitly asked my TA in class if there was anything else that needed to be set up in person in order to be able to 
remote access at a later point and submit the assignment, and I was told there wasn't. When I realized that 2FA was needed I emailed my TA regarding this and whether I can set it up during a another lab section to set and have
still yet to recieve a response. I set up the 2FA by finding someone to let me into the room on Thursday, Febuary 2, and didn't submit till today due to catching covid-19 for which I have alread submitted an ACR. I am hoping 
that you could accept my late submission and give it a maximum of 2 days late deduction. Thank you. 

Questions: 
1. You can make the first =0 and last = to the number of elements which would be 'n'.
