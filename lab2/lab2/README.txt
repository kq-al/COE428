This lab had two requirements: 
1. To answer 5 questions.
	This was solved by reading through the code and understanding the tower of Hanoi problem. 
2. To modify the towersMain.c file to catch bugs and errors. 
	This was solved by carefully acounting for each case and writing out the code carefully. 
Both requirements were solved with no errors. 


Questions: 
1. The first recursive call will be towers(4,2,1) followed by towers(3,2,3), towers(2,2,1), towers(1,2,3), ....

2. There will be five recursive calls to towers() before hte first recursive call actually reutrns to teh initial invocation? 

3. The output will be: 
	2 3
Moving the topmost disk from towers 2, to towers 3. 

4. The second recursive call will be towers(3,2,3). 


Q5. Using the formula (2^n) - 1 : which is two the power of n and subtracted by 1. Plugging in n = 8, we get 255 lines.
